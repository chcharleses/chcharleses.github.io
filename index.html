        <h3><br><q>A date which will live in infamy</b></h3>
        <p style="font-size: 24px">
          <q>Tora! Tora! Tora!</q> yelled Japanese navy captain Mitsuo Fuchida into his radio in the early morning of December 7, 1941. 
          For the next two hours, hellfire rained on the U.S. naval base of Pearl Harbor. 
          The goal of the Japanese was simple: destroy the U.S.'s naval fleet to ensure easy conquest of Ally and American bases in Singapore and the Philippines. 
          From there, the Japanese would be able to dominate the Pacific theater and conquer the Dutch East Indies, which America had been poised to prevent. 
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 24px">
          The effects of the attack were devastating. 
          Thousands of Americans lost their lives, many of whom were among the ships that sank or exploded. 
          Soldiers and innocent civilians were all impacted. 
          President Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered a passionate speech the day after and Congress quickly voted to declare war on Japan. 
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 24px">
          As the event that directly pulled the U.S. into World War II, the results are relatively well-known and taught in most American History classes in the U.S. 
          Instead, let's take a look backward in time at some events that are not usually taught in school.
          We will look to the history of Pearl Harbor and America's colonization of Hawai'i.

        <h2>The Acquisition of Pearl Harbor</h2>
        <h3>Wai Momi, meaning "Pearl Waters"</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 24px">
          Ever since the 19th century, American interest in Hawai'i had grown. 
          America quickly became involved with Hawai'i, for better and for worse. 
          The geographic location of Hawai'i was too perfect for the United States to leave alone, and the constant interference in Hawaiian affairs by Americans eventually led to the colonization of Hawai'i. 
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 24px">
          At first, traders were interested in Hawai'i because of its supply of sandalwood (a type of aromatic wood from native trees), which was in high demand by China (for goods like incense). 
          The sandalwood trade was very prosperous for American traders. 
          It was similarly prosperous for Hawaiians, who now had a plentiful supply of a product of high monetary value. 
          Whole villages of Hawaiian ali'i men abandoned their homes and families for days and weeks on end to harvest sandalwood in groups of thousands. 
          With few people to tend to the farmlands, villages were plagued with famine. 
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 24px">
          Hawaiians traded sandalwood to the Americans and Europeans in exchange for other goods. 
          Soon, though, the demand for sandalwood decreased. 
          China was becoming addicted to opium and natural forestation was devastated anyway. 
          Throughout this time though, sugar was also an important commodity. 
          Sugar quickly replaced sandalwood as America's product of choice from Hawai'i. 
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 24px">
          Aside from trade, the Americans also knew that Hawai'i, especially the location of what Hawaiians call Wai Momi, would be an important location for the military. 
          However, the waters at Pearl Harbor were naturally too shallow for ships to pull in. 
          After a lot of political back and forth, the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875, ratified in 1887, granted the U.S. exclusive access to Pearl Harbor 
          "to establish and maintain there a coaling and repair station for the use of vessels of the US and to that end the US may improve the entrance to said harbor and do all things useful to the purpose aforesaid."
          The hope for Hawai'i was that this would strengthen their trading bonds and open up the trading channel for sugar with the U.S. (specifically, the sale of sugar to the U.S. duty-free).  
          At this point, colonization by the United States had already begun - Hawai'i was becoming dependent on the U.S. while the U.S. exploited the resources and land of Hawai'i. 
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 24px">
          Many people at the time already knew what the acquisition of Pearl Harbor implied for the future of Hawai'i.

        <h2>The Annexation of Hawai'i</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 24px">
          Americans moved to Hawai'i to take advantage of the resources and people. 
          Many of these people believed the Hawaiian people to be savages who were incapable of governing themselves and knew nothing of the outside world. 
          While it was true that Hawai'i (and most of the other Pacific islands) were isolated from the rest of the Western world, they did know that it existed. 
          Most cultures passed on their history through oral traditions and primary sources indicate that they had great knowledge of the world around them. 
          However, this didn't matter to the white folk who had gone to Hawai'i for greed and fortune. 
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 24px">
          In the 1800s, the Kingdom of Hawai'i was a monarchy. 
          However, many of the new white settlers didn't like that the monarch had so much power and therefore plotted to transfer that power to themselves. 
          Through a series of constitutions and resolutions, the elite class was able to disenfranchise many people of the Kingdom. 
          Such acts included limiting voting rights to only people who earned more than some threshold of annual income and people who owned property worth over some threshold. 
          This unequally affected many natives and gave the elite more power. 
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 24px">
          The elite had already done this previously, too. 
          The Great Mahele in 1848 introduced the concept of private land ownership to Hawai'i. 
          The split of lands to the King, to Chiefs, and to the government for redistribution were unfair, but the subsequent Kuleana Act and Alien Land Ownership Act of 1850 ensured that many native Hawaiians could not own land. 
          The natives faced implicit obstacles in applications for land grants and foreigners quickly came to sweep up land claims. 
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 24px">
          This was not enough for the colonizers though. 
          The colonizers formed a group called the "Hawaiian League" whose sole purpose was to bring about the end of the kingdom. 
          In 1887, King David Kalakaua ruled over Hawai'i and, at gunpoint by a militia organized by the Hawaiian League, was forced to sign a new constitution limiting his power and transferring that power to the elite. 
          This constitution is nicknamed the "Bayonet Constitution" in allusion to the circumstances under which it was signed. 
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 24px">
          In 1891, Queen Lili'uokalani took the throne. 
          She learned that King Kalakaua has signed and defended the Bayonet Constitution under duress and fear of harm, so she sought to restore power to the throne with a new constitution. 
          Again, the Hawaiian League, now called the "Committee of Safety," led by Sanford B. Dole (cousin of the founder of the Dole plantations) organized a coup. 
          Under the guise of protecting American citizens, they were able to get American soldiers deployed to the island and stormed the palace. 
          Wishing for no conflict, the Queen ordered her forces to surrender. 
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 24px">
          The colonizers had successfully overthrown the Kingdom of Hawai'i and instilled themselves as a provisional government. 
          Their last goal was annexation by the United States. 
          They submitted treaties to the United States asking for annexation, but most Hawaiians opposed this. 
          Hawaiians held peaceful protests and signed petitions to stop the annexation. 
          The annexation was initially blocked and even ruled to be illegal thanks to the movements of the Hawaiians, but once the Spanish-American War began in 1898, Congress approved formal annexation. 
          Hawai'i became an official territory of the United States and, in 1959, became a state.

        <h2>The Military, Hidden in Plain Sight</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 24px">
          Today, the islands of Hawai'i are a hot tourist destination. 
          As such, tourism is also what a large portion of the economy is built around. 
          On average, tourists spent more than $50 million a day in 2019. 
          In fact, looking around, Hawai'i just seems like a great vacation spot. 
          What people don't see, though, is that there is military everywhere. 
          It is hidden in plain sight. 
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 24px">
          O'ahu is the most popular island for tourism. 
          It makes up nearly half of all the income generated by tourism. 
          Surprisingly, the U.S. military controls nearly 25% of the land on O'ahu and over 50% of all military land rests on the crown lands of Hawai'i. 
          The existence of the military in Hawai'i is a grim reminder of the effects of colonialism. 
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 24px">
          Hawai'i is obviously a strategic military location for the United States. 
          In fact, there are 11 military bases throughout the islands, and each branch of the military has at least one base there. 
          For the continental U.S., many young adults are funneled into the military for financial reasons (the main one being to pay for higher education). 
          This effect is even worse for the natives of Hawai'i. 
          The natives have been historically disadvantaged by meddling by America, so many young Hawaiians join the military (and they make up a staggering proportion of the military). 
          Apart from Hawaiians, there are many non-Hawaiians in the military who are in the military and stationed in Hawai'i. 
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 24px">
          Many Hawaiians are dependent on the military for survival and they cannot be blamed for joining the military. 
          This presents problems for other Hawaiians, most of whom do not support the United States and still wish to be free of their colonizers. 
          Military personnel living off-base are given generous housing stipends that native Hawaiians often cannot match. 
          Landlords are able to drive up rent prices because military members can afford to pay it, causing pervasive houselessness of native Hawaiians in their own homeland. 
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 24px">
          The effects of the military are well-known by native Hawaiians.

        <p style="font-size: 24px">
          As a direct result of the attacks on Pearl Harbor, the American government started testing out weapons in Hawai'i. 
          The most major of these tests were carried out on the island of Kaho'olawe. 
          A beautiful island home to many natives and a sacred location for Hawaiians, Kaho'olawe was appropriated by the military. 
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 24px">
          The people of Kaho'olawe were kicked off the island and bombings commenced. 
          The United States tested bombs and even torpedos from submarines by blasting them into the natural landscape of Kaho'olawe. 
          In 1965, the United States conducted a series of tests, now called the "Sailor Hat" bombings, to test the effect of nuclear bombs on Navy ships. 
          To simulate a nuclear explosion, the military piled 500 tons of TNT on a small peninsula protruding into the sea. 
          They then anchored Navy ships specific distances away from the explosion to measure the effects on the ships. 
          They did this three times, each with a new set of TNT. 
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 24px">
          By the time all of this bombing was done, craters filled the landscape of Kaho'olawe. 
          Onlookers commented on the sheer size and destruction of the land where the Sailor Hat bombings were conducted. 
          The United States gave this island back to Hawai'i in 1993 filled with waste, debris, and unexploded ordnance. 
          Even today, nearly three decades later, people have not been able to fully clean up the island. 
          It is a dark side of Hawai'i that tourists don't get to see and often are unaware of.

        <h2><q>Gifts</q> to Hawaiians</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 24px">
          The opportunity to live in houses is granted by American values and institutions. 
          Many Hawaiians who choose to assimilate into American society (e.g., by working for hotel chains on the islands) believe that they are given this opportunity thanks to their culture. 
          The Hawaiians who join the military see it as a way to maintain a bond with their friends and family. 
          Hawaiians are forced to either assimilate or live life as second-class citizens. 
          They are forced to choose between protecting their culture or accepting a dependence on their colonizers. 
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 24px">
          The University of Hawai'i, the major institution is similarly stuck between a rock and a hard place. 
          Many of the University's large grants come from the Department of Defense. 
          Although the research that such grants are made to support are not explicitly for the development of "offensive weapons," it is undeniable that such research greatly improves the position of the United States military. 
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 24px">
          Much of the research supported by the United States Department of Defense is undeniably conducted specifically in Hawai'i. 
          As expected, a lot of support is given to research for marine biology and ocean science, which the geographic location of Hawai'i is perfect for. 
          Similarly, a lot of research is done in astronomy. 
          Hawai'i, most especially the peak of Mauna Kea, is the best place in the world to study the sky and stars above. 
          Mauna Kea rises well above the clouds and the climate lends itself to perfectly calm skies, allowing astronomers to have an unparalleled view of the sky. 
          Since the 1900s, the peak of Mauna Kea has been home to the world's most powerful telescopes, which have contributed to nearly all important astronomical findings. 
          This astronomy is cited as a boon to the economy of Hawai'i. 
          Income from taxes helps construct roads and social services and astronomy provides clean jobs in STEM fields that helps elevate Hawaiian education. 
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 24px">
          However, these benefits fail to take into account the astronomical cultural and natural resource degradation caused by astronomy to Mauna Kea. 
          For the past 50 years, land ordinances provide benefits to institutions like the University of Hawai'i to perform work on the mountain. 
          However, the institutions always do more than is allowed and retroactively change guidelines and policies to allow for it.

        <h2>Protectors vs Protestors</h2>
        <h3>Kia'i, meaning <q>Protectors</q></h3>
        <p style="font-size: 24px">
          With all of the problems occurring in Hawai'i, native Hawaiians and other activists have been rising up to prevent further destruction of their land and culture. 
          A major tactic by the State is to give themselves sovereignty and depict themselves as being the first and to depict the Hawaiians as the responders. 
          They call the activists protestors responding to actions that the government voted on. 
          In reality though, the activists existed first and are not protestors. 
          They are protectors. 
          The Hawaiians existed in the land before the State did and fight to keep their land and culture the way it has been, to protect it. 
          The State instead tries to portray these protectors as protestors and criminals. 
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 24px">
          In protesting the expansion of astronomy sites on Mauna Kea, the Kia'i (protectors) appropriated a crosswalk, a state-sanctioned safe space, to block construction vehicles and crew from ascending the mountain. 
          In response, the State erased the crosswalk to criminalize their activities. 
        </p>
        <p style="font-size: 24px">
          Education is one of the biggest allies for protectors. 
          By teaching and learning about Hawaiian culture, history, and language, we can make sure that we are protecting their identity. 
          In educating ourselves about the conflicts in Hawai'i, we can make sure that we understand when policies have implicit effects on Hawai'i and to make sure that we know what acts are beneficial or detrimental to the cause.
